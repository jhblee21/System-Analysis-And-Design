# System Analysis and Design
This is my portfolio for System Analysis and Design course at Southern New Hampshire University. The Business Requirements Document (BRD), Model Application Short Paper, and System Design Document (SDD) artifacts in this portfolio demonstrate my proficiency in the following competencies:
* Ability to explain the principles, methods, and techniques of systems development
* Ability to create various system models through the application of appropriate tools
* Ability to present and articulate technical concepts to nontechnical audiences

# Briefly summary of the DriverPass project
DriverPass is a fictional company that provides on-the-road driving lessons, as well as online practice exams for driving students. The owner of DriverPass would like to leverage the new system to track and manage the operation through report generating, while allowing students (customers) to purchase and schedule driving lessons, drivers to log driving notes after providing driving lessons, secretary users to create new driving lesson appointments and modify existing appointments, and administrators to control different user accounts. For this project, I developed the BRD, the Model Application Short Paper, and the SDD for the DriverPass system. 

# What did you do particularly well?
In these documents, I effectively describe the following:

*Business Requirements Document*
* System description
* Business requirements (Functional and Non-Functional Requirements)
* User interface requirements
* Assumptions and Limitations of the system
* Project schedule (Gantt chart)

*Model Application Short Paper*
* Model applications (Process Model & Object Model)
* Comparison of Process Model & Object Model

*System Design Document*
* UML diagrams (Use case, Activity, Sequence, and Class diagram)
* System Technical requirements (Hardware, Software, Infrastructure)

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the User Interface Requirements and expand on the interface requirements for each user in greater depth.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To understand the needs of the users, I need to know more about the user - who they are, what they do, what their pain points are, and what they expect from the system. For this project, I reviewed and analyzed the transcript of the interview with the owner of DriverPass to identify the all of the requirements for the new system. It is critical to consider the needs of the users when designing the system, because the system must -- within limits and reasons --  satisfy the needs by providing the right functionalities for the users. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The level of effort in software design varies from project to project, depending on factors such as the complexity of the software, client/stakeholder involvement, and the level of effort in the software development process. In general, my approach to software design aligns closely with the software requirements and users' needs to ensure that all specified functionalities are captured, verified, implemented, and tested. Having said that, non-functional aspect such as the software security is also considered in my design – i.e., the adherence to the requirement and users' needs should not compromise the security of the software. As stated in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics, one of the professional responsibilities of a computing professional is to “[d]esign and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure” (ACM Code 2018 Task Force, 2018). Other aspect such as the software performance is also considered in my software design approach.
